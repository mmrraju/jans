## Local User Management

In this document we will cover managing people in the Jans Server's LDAP Directory and Jans TUI.


## Manage data in Jans LDAP

All the data generated by the Jans Server is stored in the local LDAP server included in every deployment. This includes OpenID Connect client data, session data, tokens, user data, and more.

Use an LDAP browser like [JXplorer](http://jxplorer.org/) or [Apache Directory Studio](https://directory.apache.org/studio/) and can find the configuration in `/etc/jans/conf/jans-ldap.properties`, e.g.:

For Jans OpenDJ, it will look like this:
```
bindDN: cn=directory manager
bindPassword: rmQQI/sax0U=
servers: localhost:1636

```

Establish a tunnel from your computer to the target Jans Server's LDAP. Tunneling is required because Jans Server's LDAP port, 1636, is not exposed to the internet.

In the below example we are showing how to connect and use Jans Server's internal LDAP server with any LDAP browser.

* Sign in with `sudo su -`
* Create tunnel:
* `ssh -fNL 5901:localhost:1636 [username]@[ip_of_Jans_server]`
* Open LDAP browser
* Create new connection

* Perform authentication. 'Password' is the the password of 'admin' user.
